## tricks for Nexus 9(volantis)

**volantis** has a dummy header of size 256 bytes, which looks like this:

We have to trim the header before it can be recognized by our toy.

    $ dd if=boot.img of=raw_boot bs=256 skip=1

Now we can work with 'raw\_boot'

    $ cp raw_boot boot.img
    $ gradle unpack
    $ gradle pack

## Pixel XL (marlin)

**marlin** is a profile that adopts A/B system schema while still using Verified Boot 1.0 style boot image.

Due to the configuration "BOARD_BUILD_SYSTEM_ROOT_IMAGE := true", the embeded ramdisk in boot.img is actually used in recovery mode.

## NX606J

Thanks to the work by [CallMESuper], ZTE NX606J boot.img is also verified to be compatible with this toolkit.
